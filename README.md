# Udacity - Design Patterns Course
Repository of [Udacity's Design Patterns Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).

## Content
This course covers methods for organizing your code, both conceptually and literally. You’ll learn the importance of separating concerns when writing JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience along the way. Separating concerns can be done with or without an organizational library or framework. We’ll learn how to separate concerns without one, and then we’ll explore an organizational library together. You’ll also learn strategies for exploring other libraries and frameworks on your own.

By the end of this course, you’ll understand (from experience) the importance of code organization, and how to implement it with either vanilla JavaScript or an organizational library or framework. Your applications will start looking clean and professional—not just to your users, but also to anyone who looks at the code driving your applications.
